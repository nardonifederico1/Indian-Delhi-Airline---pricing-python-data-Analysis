**Indian Flight Market Analysis**

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and price prediction on airline data for flights departing from several destinations focused in the eastern continent, specifically India. 

**Context**
The original problem statement and dataset were inspired by a technical assessment. All code provided in this repository is my original work, developed independently for learning and skill-refinement purposes. This project is not affiliated with, nor endorsed by, any specific organization.
The project was developed as a personal challenge to refine my Python data science skills. It originates from a technical simulation involving real-world aviation data from the Indian market. The goal was to clean, merge, and analyze complex datasets to extract meaningful insights about flight pricing and duration, while answering to key questions regarding analysis of data.

**Data Source**
The dataset includes flight information (Airlines, Class, Stops, Duration) and pricing details (Fare in INR and GBP). The data is used for educational and didactical purposes only.
